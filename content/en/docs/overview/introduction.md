## Transyra

Managed File Transfer is a technology solution that enables secure, reliable and efficient transfer of files between different systems and networks. MFT helps organisations to streamline their data transfers and enable ad-hoc file transfers on the fly.

Transyra provides advanced MFT solution with key focus on following areas. 

## Features

#### Autonomous Agents
The solution utilizes autonomous agents that can independently perform file transfer tasks without constant human intervention. These agents can be deployed on various systems or endpoints to facilitate secure and reliable file transfers.

#### Centralized Configuration
The configuration of the autonomous agents is centrally managed through a centralized control panel or management console. Administrators can define transfer settings, security policies, file retention policies, scheduling options, and other parameters from a single web interface.

 #### Event-Based Triggers
MFT with an Autonomous Centrally Configured Agent allows the creation of event-based triggers to initiate file transfers automatically. Administrators can define triggers based on specific events such as file arrival, time-based schedules, or system events, ensuring timely and automated file transfers.

#### Monitoring and Alerting
The solution provides monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track the status of file transfers and agent performance. Administrators can receive real-time alerts for successful transfers, failures, or other predefined events, enabling proactive management and issue resolution.

<!-- #### Security and Compliance
The solution incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive data during file transfers. It supports encryption protocols, secure authentication mechanisms, and data integrity checks to ensure secure and compliant file transfers. Additionally, audit logs and reporting capabilities help organizations meet compliance requirements. -->

<!-- #### Integration and Extensibility
MFT with an Autonomous Centrally Configured Agent can integrate with existing systems and applications, allowing seamless file transfer automation within established workflows. It also provides extensibility through APIs, enabling developers to integrate the solution with custom applications or extend its functionality as needed. -->
