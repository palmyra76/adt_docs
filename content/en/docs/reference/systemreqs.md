## Software

* Any Linux distribution

* Java Runtime 17

* Supports Standalone, Dockerized or Cloud deployment

## Minimum Hardware
* Processor: A minimum of a 2-core x86_64 processor is required. This provides sufficient processing power to handle the file transfer tasks efficiently.

* RAM: A minimum of 256MB of RAM is recommended. This allows the agent to allocate sufficient memory for its operations, ensuring smooth performance.

It's important to note that these requirements represent the minimum specifications to run the agent effectively. Depending on the scale of your file transfer operations and the number of concurrent transfers, you may need to consider higher specifications to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

Additionally, it is advisable to consider factors such as disk space for storing transferred files, network bandwidth to handle file transfer traffic, and any specific requirements related to the operating system.
