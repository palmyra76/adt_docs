Agents in server can provide flexibility by allowing users to customize their settings and expand their functionality.

It can be set up to work on multiple ports, which means they can handle file transfers on different port numbers at the same time.

Agents enable the automation of tasks and processes, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

A single user can access multiple agents across various types of servers.

Agent settings can be customized to stop automatic file transfers when the storage is full, avoiding problems caused by exceeding the storage capacity.
