The SFTP Client provides a secure way to transfer files by establishing a secure connection to the server, requiring authentication with a username and password. It enables easy file uploading to the target folder and allows for folder deletion and movement within the target folder to a specified location.

**Target Folder:** It determines the destination directory on the remote server where files will be transferred or accessed by the SFTP client.

**IP Address:** It is used by the SFTP client to locate and connect to the SFTP server for secure file transfers over the network.

**Port Number:** It allows the SFTP client to specify the endpoint on the server to establish the connection.

**Username:** The username serves as a unique identifier for the SFTP client.

**Password:** The password serves as a secret authentication credential for the SFTP client.

**Base Folder:** It defines the starting directory or root location for file operations performed by the SFTP client on the remote server.

**Scan Interval:** The server can be configured to access the data at any specified time interval.
