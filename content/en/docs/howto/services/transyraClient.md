A Site-Site client is a tool that helps upload large files over the internet in a reliable and efficient way. It allows the upload to be split into smaller parts, can resume from where it left off if interrupted, and keeps track of the upload progress.

**API Key:** API keys are unique identifiers used by the Site-Site client client to authenticate and authorize access to the Site-Site client server's API, similar to secret passwords. They are included in the connection details to establish a secure connection and upload files.

**Tokens:** Tokens are generated by the TUS server and issued to clients for authentication purposes. The client includes the token in the connection details to authenticate with the server.
